% questions for simon:
% 1) counts are proportional to?
% 2) re: solve 1 - exp(-l) = 1 for l.  What is the limiting variable? 

\begin{abstract}
The modeling of a predator's prey selection has a breif history that includes many intuitive indices, few of which have both reasonable statistical justification and tractable asymptotic properties.  Here, we provide a simple model that meets both of these criteria, while extending previous work to include an array of multiple species and time points.  Further, we apply the Expectation-Maximization algorithm to cases where exact counts of the number of prey species eaten in a particular timer period is not observed.  Simulations yada yada yada...
