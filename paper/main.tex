\begin{abstract}
The literature on modeling a predator's prey selection includes many intuitive indices, few of which have both reasonable statistical justification and tractable asymptotic properties.  Here, we provide a simple model that meets both of these criteria, while extending previous work to include an array of multiple species and time points.  Further, we apply the Expectation-Maximization algorithm to cases where exact counts of the number of prey species eaten in a particular timer period is not observed.  A simulation is provided to demonstrate the accuracy of our methods.
