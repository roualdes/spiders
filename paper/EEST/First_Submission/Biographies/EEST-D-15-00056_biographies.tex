\textbf{Simon Bonner} is an Assistant Professor jointly appointed between the Department of Statistical and Actuarial Sciences and the Department of Biology at the University of Western Ontario, London, Ontario, Canada (sbonner6@uwo.ca). His research focuses primarily on developing statistical methods for the analysis of ecological data with particular emphasis on Bayesian methods for analyzing data from mark-recapture studies of wild animals. This work was completed while Simon was an Assistant Professor in the Department of Statistics at the University of Kentucky.

\textbf{James Harwood} is an Associate Professor of Insect Ecology in the Department of Entomology at the University of Kentucky, Lexington, Kentucky, USA (james.harwood@uky.edu). His research seeks to understand mechanisms of foraging by generalist predators and identify their role in biological control through the integration of molecular techniques, behavioral studies and field experiments.
