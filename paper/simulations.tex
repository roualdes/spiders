\section*{Simulations}
\label{sec:sim}

Our simulations hypothesize two prey species, and five time points.  Of the hierarchy of hypotheses, we consider the four most interesting cases $\{c, c_s, c_t, c_st\}$.  Sample sizes are chosen randomly from four overlapping levels.  We put ``small'' sample sizes to be randomly sampled numbers in $[20,50]$, ``medium'' encompasses $[30:75]$, ``large'' $[50,150]$, and ``huge'' $[100,200]$.  Hence, we randomly sample trap and predator observations for each occurence from one of the sample size levels, then cycle through all hypotheses.  This is repeated for each level of sample size.  We simulate data for each of the $16$ scenarios above under both the standard maximum likelihood theory and under the EM algorithm.  Only the details of the EM algorithm are presented here, as the other simulations are standard theory of point estimation.
